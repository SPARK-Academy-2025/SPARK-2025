## About SPARK  
The Sprint AI Training for African Medical Imaging Knowledge Translation (SPARK) program is designed to train a new generation of African artificial intelligence (AI) experts in medical imaging who can train others. We use a case-based learning approach and collective intelligence from various related fields (radiology, medical physics, computer science, neurology/neurosurgery, and oncology) to rapidly turn AI knowledge into action.  

Each SPARK Academy is aimed at a real-world use case and implements collective intelligence built around a networking space to advance AI capacity and rapid implementation in Africa. SPARK Academy is endorsed by The Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) Society and, over the past two years, has trained over 350 African clinicians, scientists, and students from 23 African countries, guiding them in developing state-of-the-art AI methods for glioma brain tumor segmentation. The program is expanding and now includes participants from three Southeast Asian countries.
